40 sites, thickness of humic layer

25 untreated boards in a grid,

mark recapture of the salamander -- recapture is low

abundance, rather than mark recapture -- if you recapture a marked salamander 


### five models

* forest floor depth \ earthorms
* salamanders ~ earthworms

worms make salamanders
* does salamander size change with and without earthworms
* demographic structure of -- proportion of juveniles of all salamnders
* diet! subset of 40 sites. earthworm biomass, gut contents of salamanders
20 different sites.
